This homework is about making custom components

Recreate the components mentioned below, all you need is a 
visual representation of them. Up to you to make it work. 

Most have simple state and are focused on the visual.
Feel free to create a .css file if you need to use styles to shape the components

Click the toggle/expand full code to see how some props are expected to be used


1. Basic Stepper (https://primereact.org/stepper/)

Focus on the first example the basic one

2. Basic Breadcrumb (https://primereact.org/breadcrumb/)

3. Multiple Metergroup (https://primereact.org/metergroup/)

Focus on the first and second example, the horisontal versions

4. Make a custom component List, it will be used anytime we need to use a list (ol/ul)

The goal of this component is to save us time from writing a simple .map() everytime there is an array

It takes three props `items`, `field` and `type`. 
* Items is always going to be an array, it can be an array of strings/numbers or array of objects
* If it is an array of strings/numbers, then we don't need the `field` prop
* The `field` prop is only needed for array with objects and it will specify which key will be used for display

example: {title: "Book 1", author: "Stefan"} if the field={"title"} then we will use the "Book 1" value to put on the screen

* the `type` value  by default will be "ul" but it can also be provided and either be "ul" or "ol" and depending on it 
we should see an ordered list or unordered list. 
* For keys, if its normal array (strings/numbers) we use the index as the key, if its array with objects and the objecst have a key "id",
then we use the "id", otherwise we use the index again.

The ui is simple, it will be just a ul > li with single text inside of it

<ul>
    <li> First item </li>
    <li> Second item </li>
    ...
</ul>

5. Choose another component you want to make, google "react ui libraries" explore some of them
and choose a component you want to recreate it can be simple or complex up to you.

Provide a link of the one you are going for.
