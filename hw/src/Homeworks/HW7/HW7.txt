H7: Deadline 29 April (7 Days)
Upload it with the commit message "H7 Done"

topics: useRef + controled inputs



1. Recreate this (https://codepen.io/Hoovian/pen/mdgpadP). Make a component FakeSignUp.

- At the end when clicking submit, you should pass the data to the `processData` function.
You can find the function in the H7.js file. Explore it to see how the data is expected
to look like.

- Based on the return value of the function, show the error / success message under
the submit button.

- Make sure that people can only try to submit a bad form maximum 6 times. If someone reaches
the 6 failed attempts, show a new message "You are banned from submitting again" and make the 
submit button disabled.

Hints: 

- before you try solving figure out which are the moving parts (state)
- break down the task into mini tasks and do as much as you can
- try to think what will need to be in state and what doesn't need to be and can be used by useRef
- try to solve each part that you can, and if you get stuck write down a short note
which part is hard to accomplish and how you tried to solve it (i will read these later)
- use good variable state names and add comments explaining parts of the code 

Extra: 

- Replace the checkboxes with a dropdown (select).
