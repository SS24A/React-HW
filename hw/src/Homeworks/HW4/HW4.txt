1. Make a Counter component that has two buttons
One button increments the counter by 2 and a
second button that increments the counter by 2


2. Make a Counter2 component that has an increment and decrement
buttons. It also should take a prop `amount` which is a number.
The counter should be updated by the amount value

ex: if amount=5 , then `counter + 5` and `counter - 5`

3. Make a Counter3 component that has an increment and decrement functionality
It should not go above 30 and it should not go below 0.

4. Make a LuckyCounter, that only increments by 1. Every time the counter
number is divisible by 3 it should render(show) 'lucky' instead of the number

5. Make a component called RevealText. It should take a prop `text` that
is a string ex:"Superstar"

Make a button that will have the text "Reveal" and when we click it it should
show a letter from the text. If we click it enough times it should show the whole
text. 

ex: text is "Superstar" and with each click we will get 

S
Su
Sup
Supe
Super
Supers
Superst
Supersta
Superstar

Once it is revealed fully, additional text should appear underneath 
"Word Revealed" with green text

6. Make a component TV that is meant to represent TV channels. It takes a 
prop `channels` which is an array of strings.

const tvChannels = [
  "ABC",
  "CBS",
  "NBC",
  "FOX",
  "CNN",
  "Fox News",
  "MSNBC",
  "ESPN",
  "BBC",
  "HBO",
  "Discovery Channel",
  "National Geographic Channel",
  "Netflix",  
  "Hulu",     
];

In the beginning show the first channel (we start the TV ON) 

Create a button that has the text "Next Channel" 

When we click the button we should show the next channel (ABC -> CBS -> NBC -> ...)

Extra: When it reaches the end the channels should start from start again
just like a real TV does

Extra: If the channel starts with the letter "N" or "F" it should have a bigger
font 20px and the other should be font size 16px
