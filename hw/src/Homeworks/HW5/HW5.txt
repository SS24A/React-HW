2. Make the same component as above <Lightbulb2/> but this time, we dont have the button, we click on the
image to change it to the next state

-----

3. Make a show password text input component. <Password /> which has an input and a button. 
The button should switch  between "Hide/Show password" and the input  type should change between "text" and "password"


-----

4. Make a component called <TodoItem /> which takes in one prop `todo` which is an object. You should use
the prop to make the initial state of the state. If the todo is completed cross the text if not, its like normal.
To invoke the action you should click on the text field itself.

const todo = {
    text: "Do Homework",
    completed: "false"
}

output: 

<div> <span> Do Homework </span> </div>

5. Make a component <BigSmallBox /> that will represent a `div` element that is a Box shaped (equal sides).
Play with the width and heigth. 
Clicking on the box changes it to the next shape. The box can be in two sizes: big and small
Small box is 50px
Big box is 100px

-----

6. Make a component <Box /> that will represent a `div` element that is box shaped (equal sides)

Play with the width and heigth. 
Clicking on the box changes it to the next shape, box can be in three sizes. big, normal and small
Small box is 50px
Normal box is 100px
Big box is 150px

-----

7. Make a keyboard (part of it) component <Keyboard /> that takes a list of characters as a prop called `chars`.

chars=["a", "b", "c", "d", " "]

- chars is always lowercase letters and only letters.
- You will have to add one space button by yourself at the end.
- Make a component <Key /> that takes a prop `char` and displays a button with the char as value.
- When clicked the button from `Key` should have visible change when clicked (play with css active class)
- Normal button should be white background and black text, active button should be black bg and white text
- ex: <Key char="m" /> will become <button> m </button> (class and event will need to be added)
- for the space button it should be: <Key char=" " /> -----> <button> Space </button>
- `Keyboard` should return a `div` for displaying the written text and `Key` component for each char in the chars list.
- When we click the Key's button it should add the text onto the screen (in the div).
- Add a "clear" button that will reset the text back to empty.

8. Keyboard2 (task 7 but with extra features), 
Extra: (if you are going to )
- Make a CapsLock button, that can be turned on and off, the text should always be "Caps Lock". 
When it is on it needs to have the 'active' state when it is off it is a 'normal' button (the css from before for normal/active).
- When we click on Key to type, if capslock is active then the letter should be a capital letter otherwise
always lowercase.
- You should probably modify the `Key` component for this to be able to happen
