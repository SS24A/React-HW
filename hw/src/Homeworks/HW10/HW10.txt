This homework is about making custom hooks and working with context


Make/Recreate the following custom hooks. You can see how they are used
and recreate them so that they can be used in the same way 
(small modifications are ok if you cant exactly replicate).

Hint: first solve the task without custom hook, for example make a 
timer component, make a mouse movement detection component etc. and
figure out which pieces of logic are connected and can be extracted into a 
custom component.

Also while submiting the homework, aside from the custom hook code, provide
a basic example usecase where you are using the hook. You can use the same examples 
that are used for showcase in the links

1. useWindowScroll (https://mantine.dev/hooks/use-window-scroll/)

2. useMouse (https://mantine.dev/hooks/use-mouse/)

3. useEvent (https://mantine.dev/hooks/use-event-listener/)

4. useTimer

 const { time, isRunning, startTimer, stopTimer, resetTimer } = useTimer();

5. useRenderCount (https://usehooks.com/userendercount)

6. useIsFirstRender (https://usehooks.com/useisfirstrender)
